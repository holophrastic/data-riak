  - Fix flaking tests by giving Riak more time to finish processing the
    requests sent
  - Deal gracefully with RemoveObject requests returning results without
    a VClock

  - This release contains a lot of new features and various refactorings that
    make it not fully backward compatible with earlier versions of Data::Riak.
    Sorry!

  - Refactor the Result API to provide only methods that make sense for a
    given result
  - Add an abstraction over the various Riak requests
  - Stop retrieving bucket props in list_keys
  - Add structured exceptions
  - Add set_props to set bucket properties
  - Remove Bucket->indexing as it never actually worked
  - Handle vector clocks
